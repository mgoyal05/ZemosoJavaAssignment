1. java.util.Arrays#asList()                                                                
      This function returns a 'list' view of the specified array given as argument.
      
      Example showing the usage of the method
         // create an array of strings
         String array[] = new String[]{"abc","klm","xyz","pqr"};
         List list1 = Arrays.asList(array);
         
      Array and List are two incompatible interfaces but Array want to implement List interface which is done here by using 
      'Adapter Pattern'
      Here Adaptee(Array) sends the request to asList(Adapter) to implement the target Interface(List). It creates a private 
      static class ArrayList which implements all the methods of class 'List' like size(), toArray(), etc. It converted the 
      Array into List interface which the method wants by having a common shared interface List/Abstract List.
  
2.  java.util.Collections#list()
    public static <T> ArrayList<T> list(Enumeration<T> e)
      This function Returns an array list containing the elements of the given Enumeration.
         
      Example showing the usage of the method
        Enumeration e = v.elements();
        // get the list
        ArrayList arrlist = Collections.list(e);        //Returns an ArrayList containing all elements of enumeration
      
      This method act as an interface between two incompatible interfaces Enumeration and ArrayList which is done here by
      using 'Adapter Pattern'.
      Here Adaptee(Enumeration) sends the request to list(Adapter) method to implement the target Interface(ArrayList). It
      creates a local ArrayList and add all elements so now it act exactly like a ArrayList.
 
3.  java.util.Collections#enumeration()
    public static <T> Enumeration<T> enumeration(final Collection<T> c)
      This function does the opposite of the previous method i.e. It returns an enumeration of the given collection
      
      Example showing the usage of the method
      List arrlist = new ArrayList();
      // create Enumeration
      Enumeration e = Collections.enumeration(arrlist);
      
      This method act
